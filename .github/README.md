# What is SteamJar
SteamJar is a tool that helps you add all of your non-steam games to Steam.  
It will search for games from all supported game launchers from all known sources (Bottles, Wineprefixes) and add them as a non-steam applications.
Additionally - when missing pictures are detected, this tool will download them from SteamGridDB if you wish.
  
**[See Changelog](./CHANGELOG.md)**  
  
**Important!**  
Tested only on Steam Deck. I made sure that I use generic paths and methods to obtain things - it should work on other systems. But this is not tested! If you encounter problems, please open an Issue üëç
